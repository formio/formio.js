   - Input
   - MultiValue

   - Base classes are now stored in the "components/_classes" folder including
     - Component - Base component for most components.

    // To render a form builder
    import { FormBuilder } from 'formiojs';
    const builder = new FormBuilder(document.getElementById('builder'), {components:[]});
