 - Component class replaces the BaseComponent class.
 - Added more OOP heirarchy to components including.
   - Field
   - Input
   - MultiValue
 - Directory structure:
   - Base classes are now stored in the "components/_classes" folder including
     - Component - Base component for most components.

    ```

    // To render a form builder
    import { FormBuilder } from 'formiojs';
    const builder = new FormBuilder(document.getElementById('builder'), {components:[]});
