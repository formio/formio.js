### JavaScript Embedding

With this library, you can easly embed a form within your website by adding the ```src``` query string to the Form.io API url of your form. For example, if you wish to embed the https://examples.form.io/example form within your website, you could use.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/formiojs@latest/dist/formio.embed.js?src=https://examples.form.io/example"></script>
```

<h3>Result</h3>
<div class="well">
<script src="{{ site.baseurl }}/dist/formio.embed.js?src=https://examples.form.io/example"></script>
</div>
